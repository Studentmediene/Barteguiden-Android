Barteguiden Android
==========================

This is the repo for the Barteguiden Android app.
As we're trying to move to a web based product, this app is no longer in active development.


# Setup

When using Android Studio, setup is very simple.
Just `clone` the repo, and open it in Android studio; `gradle` _should_ take care of the rest.
